                Twenty years ago, today, you were shipped to this planet at like 9:32 am, which is widely considered a good move
                especially since you weren't born in the evening, guess we could say you were Made in the A.M hahah.
                It's been a long time since then though, and you've travelled quite a lot of places, and then your parents made this A1 decision to bring you here,
                 absolute banger move if you ask me. <br> and get this you made it through RISKâ„¢.<br>

                 20 years down the line and i'm glad you're out here showing everyone how it's done. how what's done you ask? Everything âœ¨<br>

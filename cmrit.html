                Phew! Finally made it to college, and man has it been a wild ride so far, and guess what!? you, sire, made it!
                What's the big deal you ask? everyone does it you say? it is a big deal because not everyone can make it through with as much finnese (idk how that is spelt pls forgive) 
                and here you are, a 20 year old, strong music club head, engineering aspirant, talented singer (the best i know) and one who types with auto capitalisation off :0
                <br><br>Seriously though, I'm so proud of how far you've come as a person, from being socially anxious to actually being outward with people and making anyone and everyone feel like they're Welcome
                 all the way till leading a team of the best musical artists in the city, you grow and learn everyday, even on days you can't get out of bed.
                <br><br>You're an amazing friend/sister/brother/chakka/bestfriend/club head/person, but most importantly, you're you and one day I'm hoping that you see yourself like i see you

            </p>
            
        </div>
        <p class="para2">Even on days you just wake up and go back to sleep, I'm proud of you! <br> cuz at least then you sleep F</p>
